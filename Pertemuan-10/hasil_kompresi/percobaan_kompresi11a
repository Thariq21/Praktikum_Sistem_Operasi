The $9 billion and ever-growing hyperconverged infrastructure market is hitting its stride this year with new edge solutions, more powerful servers, and software innovation at its peak.

Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, the worldwide hyperconverged market reached $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 alone, up 7.4 percent year over year, according to research firm IDC. The top market leader for HCI systems like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise continue to add new features and next-generation microprocessors to their hyperconverged product line in 2021, while software leaders such as Nutanix and VMware are innovating at breakneck speed to capture new opportunities around virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and edge computing.

According to The NPD Group, which tracks monthly technology sales-out information from the largest IT distributors and resellers across North America, hyperconverged hardware sales grew four percent year over year in the first quarter of 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated businesses’ digital transformation (DX) plans.

“Within these DX efforts, edge is quickly accelerating as needs for lower latency continue to drive further expansion and adoption. Moving data infrastructure, applications, and data resources closer to the edge will enable faster response to business needs and increased flexibility,” said NPD Group, adding that HCI is a significant enabler for edge computing.

With half of 2021 in the books, CRN takes a look at 10 of the hottest hyperconverged infrastructure systems in the market today.
